# Payroll System

## Overview
The Payroll System project is a Java program designed to calculate the payroll for employees based on their hours worked, hourly pay rate, and tax withholding rates. The program prompts the user for necessary input and then calculates the gross pay, federal and state tax withholdings, total deductions, and net pay for the employee.

## Features
- **User Input**: Prompts the user to input employee details including hours worked, hourly pay rate, and tax withholding rates.
- **Gross Pay Calculation**: Computes the gross pay based on hours worked and hourly rate.
- **Tax Withholding Calculation**: Calculates federal and state tax withholdings.
- **Total Deductions**: Computes the total deductions by summing up federal and state tax withholdings.
- **Net Pay Calculation**: Calculates the net pay after deducting total deductions from gross pay.
- **Output**: Displays the employee details, gross pay, deductions, and net pay.

## Concepts Covered
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- User Input Handling
- Payroll Calculation Algorithms
- Basic Arithmetic Operations
